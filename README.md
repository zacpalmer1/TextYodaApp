## Assignment guidlines
Create an application that implements a tip calculator. There should be one activity/screen as follows:
1. Provide a TextView prompt and an EditText field for entering the bill amount.
2. Provide at least four radio buttons for calculating the tip. When the user selects one of these buttons, both the tip and the total bill (including the tip) are automatically calculated and displayed in TextView fields. For example, the four buttons could represent a 10%, 15%, 18%, and 20% tip.
3. Edit the default theme to swap values for the primary and secondary colors; e.g.,
<item name="colorPrimary">@color/teal_200</item>. For this assignment you are not required to edit the night theme colors, but for a real production app you would likely want to edit that theme as well.
4. You are required to save/restore the state of the tip calculator, so that the state is preserved when the phoneâ€™s screen orientation changes; e.g., from portrait to landscape or vice versa.
Run the application on an Android phone or virtual device. It should look similar to the screen shot on the following page.
